Python Flask web server which will:
  1. enumerate any petbuddy-device (PBD) which connects to the server and manage a connection to it.
  2. enumerate any petbuddy-companion app (PBC) which connects to the server and manage a connection to it.
  3. serve as a middleman between the PBD and the PBC.
  4. use a sql server which will track all PBDs out in the field. It will offer a signup process during the onboarding that will be accessed through the PBC app and perhaps also a web interface

To get the flask app working through apache on the AWS instance, you have to create a virtual environment
using the virtualenv tool. This is because on AWS the environment is local, so all installed tools/utilities
go under a weird ~/.local/ directory. Coupled with apache running as root user, this may have been causing
problems. So what I had to do was create a virtualenv in my petbuddy-cloud directory, install flask in it
and then add the following to the wsgi file:

activate_this = '/path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate_this.py'
execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this)

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/flask/appname')

***********************************************************************************
1. First install mysql
   - check if you have it:
     $ mysql --version
   - if not then:
     $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client
   - mysql-server will ask for root install password during install, set
     this and save it in something like keepass

2. ....


the mysql db
*************
To access db:
   ubuntu:$ mysql -u root -p
This will give you a sql prompt like:
   mysql>
We are using the development db. To see names of all the dbs:
   mysql> show databases;

Table structure in db that stores info about PBDs:
| serial_no | last_ping	| ip_add | email_add | password |

mysql> describe pbdusrs;
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field     | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| device_id | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| serial_no | varchar(100) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| last_ping | int(11)      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| ip_add    | varchar(100) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| email     | varchar(120) | NO   | UNI | NULL    |                |
| pwdhash   | varchar(100) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

Removed stuff from Amazon AWS and switched to home raspi server.
