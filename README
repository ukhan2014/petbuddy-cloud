Python Flask web server which will:
  1. enumerate any petbuddy-device (PBD) which connects to the server and manage a connection to it.
  2. enumerate any petbuddy-companion app (PBC) which connects to the server and manage a connection to it.
  3. serve as a middleman between the PBD and the PBC.
  4. use a sql server which will track all PBDs out in the field. It will offer a signup process during the onboarding that will be accessed through the PBC app and perhaps also a web interface

To get the flask app working through apache on the AWS instance, you have to create a virtual environment
using the virtualenv tool. This is because on AWS the environment is local, so all installed tools/utilities
go under a weird ~/.local/ directory. Coupled with apache running as root user, this may have been causing
problems. So what I had to do was create a virtualenv in my petbuddy-cloud directory, install flask in it
and then add the following to the wsgi file:

activate_this = '/path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate_this.py'
execfile(activate_this, dict(__file__=activate_this)

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/flask/appname'
